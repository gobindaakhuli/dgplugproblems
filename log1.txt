[15:07:02] <kushal> Seems like we lost a few names :)
[15:07:16] <kushal> Anyway, anyone remembers what was the last session we had?
[15:07:17] <hydro> Anushil Kumar
[15:07:43] <rahuldecoded> You had given us a task
[15:07:51] <buvanesh_kumar> security topic i think
[15:08:53] <lambainsaan_> We did a practice exercise on what nick was mentioned the most by each nick.
[15:08:59] <abhishekg5> kushal: 'Who talked to whom how many times on channel' this task
[15:09:14] <kushal> abhishekg5, Okay
[15:09:17] <kushal> good
[15:09:32] <kushal> What was the last chapter we discussed from the book?
[15:10:03] <thisisashwani> Ashwani Pandey
[15:10:05] <indiabhi> roll call Abhishek Rai
[15:11:28] <kushal> strings?
[15:11:37] <kushal> Did we discuss functions?
[15:11:38] <thisisashwani> kushal: it would be great if i can know the book we are following, i haven't been here for the past 2-3 weeks. :)
[15:11:48] <abhishekg5> Strings I believe. Can someone else confirm this ?
[15:11:53] <kushal> thisisashwani, now it is your fault not to follow the logs.
[15:12:02] <buvanesh_kumar> http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
[15:12:04] <kushal> thisisashwani, we published the logs.

[15:12:57] <abstatic_> Roll Call: Abhishek Shrivastava
[15:13:08] <lambainsaan_> No kushal we did not discuss functions.
[15:13:13] <thisisashwani> kushal: i am going through the logs only right now, but if i can get the link for book right now, it would be easy for me today!

[15:13:33] skarale is now known as skarale_leaving
[15:13:34] <iKshitij> kushal I don't remember you discussed functions !
[15:13:40] <thisisashwani> kushal, buvanesh_kumar: thanks! :)
[15:13:41] <Ananthu> Roll call: An\antha krishnan PTA
[15:13:48] <PrashantJ> Functions we wrote. But have not discussed.
[15:13:55] <kushal> Okay
[15:13:59] <kushal> so that is
[15:14:57] <kushal> https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:16:08] <kushal> So there are times when we need to do similar action in different parts of our code.
[15:16:14] <kushal> We do this using functions.
[15:16:40] <kushal> Let us see the shell, if you have question as here by typin !
[15:16:44] <kushal> * typing
[15:17:30] <tgtanya> Sorry but I joined late, could you paste the link to shell again?

[15:17:52] <thisisashwani> tgtanya: https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:18:32] <ChaKu_> hey guys I apologize but I am a bit out of the loop here. What is today's training for?
[15:19:10] <kushal> As you can see we start the definition with def
[15:19:17] <kushal> and then the function name
[15:19:28] <kushal> in this case functionname is the name :)
[15:19:38] <kushal> It does not take any argument/parameter
[15:19:56] <kushal> and inside the function, I am just printing Hello
[15:20:16] <kushal> So let me call the function
[15:20:32] <ak_d> roll call: Akhilesh Dhaundiyal
[15:20:34] <abhishekg5> ChaKu_: We are doing python functions right now. https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:20:51] <code_geek> roll call: Shantanu Acharya
[15:20:59] <Anupama> roll call: Anupama Mandal
[15:21:02] <ChaKu_> Cool!
[15:21:10] <ChaKu_> roll call: Chaitanya Kukde
[15:21:17] <kushal> Is there any questions still now?
[15:22:59] <buvanesh_kumar> fine
[15:23:11] <Ananthu> no
[15:23:27] <iKshitij> No
[15:24:29] <Aizen> !
[15:24:34] <kushal> next
[15:24:37] <kushal> next
[15:24:51] <Aizen> instead of return we can write print also in add function() ?
[15:25:04] <kushal> Aizen, yes, let me show you the difference
[15:26:39] <SpEcBOT2> SpEcHiDe: Roll Call: Shrimadhav U K
[15:26:39] <kushal> Means we use return statement to actually return something from a function which we may use later
[15:26:48] <kushal> Aizen, is that useful?
[15:26:50] <Aizen> ok
[15:26:54] <Aizen> yuip :)
[15:27:09] <kushal> So remember that part.
[15:27:18] <kushal> When to print, and when to return things from a function.
[15:27:26] <tgtanya> !
[15:27:27] <Aizen> that means both have the same  functionality
[15:27:36] <kushal> Aizen, no
[15:27:42] <Aizen> ?
[15:27:47] <kushal> Aizen, add2 adds a and b, and then prints it
[15:27:53] <Aizen> yes ..
[15:27:54] <kushal> but we don't get back the result
[15:28:16] <kushal> means there is no way for program to find out the answer, so that it can not be used later.
[15:28:21] <kushal> which is true for add
[15:28:24] <kushal> next
[15:28:33] <Aizen> ok ..
[15:28:36] <abhishekg5> Aizen: if you want the value in another variable, you'll have to use return not print
[15:28:49] <tgtanya> is there any value stored in y at present?
[15:28:57] <sandeepk> Aizen: when we use return we can save that value in any variable but in case of print we cannot do so
[15:29:17] <sandeepk> tgtanya: no
[15:29:22] <kushal> tgtanya, No :)
[15:29:22] <mbtamuli12_> Roll Call: Mriyam Tamuli
[15:29:38] <kushal> tgtanya, can you see it?
[15:29:52] <tgtanya> So the print command does not return a 1 or 0 depending on success?
[15:30:09] <kushal> tgtanya, print function shows the the value on the STDOUT
[15:30:15] <kushal> it does not return anything.
[15:30:26] <tgtanya> okay
[15:30:27] <kushal> tgtanya, you will have to write a return statement for return
[15:30:56] <aniketh_> !
[15:31:00] <kushal> tgtanya, now tell me what will be returned if I call cheat(212, 3223)
[15:31:01] <kushal> ?
[15:31:03] <kushal> next
[15:31:06] <SRvSaha> Roll Call : Saurav Saha
[15:31:28] <madhurii> Roll call Madhuri Muley
[15:31:41] <SRvSaha> Sorry for being late, cause the last time I saw the topic of the channel, it was mentioned that the session is at 7pm
[15:31:43] <aniketh_> Why did type(y) showed error of "nonetype" even though its not a string ?
[15:31:55] <kushal> SRvSaha, yes, and I don't know why, I am sorry for it.
[15:31:57] <akash47> roll call : Akash Mishra
[15:32:09] <tgtanya> kushal: 1
[15:32:15] <kushal> tgtanya, Yes, correct.
[15:32:23] <kushal> aniketh_, it never showed error.
[15:32:32] <kushal> aniketh_, it showed the correct type of y
[15:32:34] <kushal> which is None
[15:32:56] <Aizen> Kushal: 1
[15:33:04] <Ananthu> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/C0fCt6S5/
[15:33:18] <Ananthu> that is the error that I got
[15:33:37] <aniketh_> kushal, sorry I read as an error my mistake.
[15:34:17] <sandeepk> Ananthu: indentation problem in your code
[15:34:27] <kushal> sandeepk, correct.
[15:34:35] <kushal> next
[15:34:35] <hydro> indentation
[15:34:38] <sandeepk> kushal: :-)
[15:35:03] <kushal> Can I continue?
[15:35:08] <abhishekg5> yes
[15:35:10] <sandeepk> Ananthu: give four space and don't mix spaces and tab.
[15:35:28] <kushal> Okay
[15:35:32] <kushal> default value.
[15:35:33] <Ananthu> !
[15:35:45] <kushal> Many times we want to have a default value for an argument.
[15:36:07] <kushal> Means if it is not passed to the function call, we will have a default value.
[15:36:13] <kushal> Let us do it now.
[15:37:42] <kushal> Now any questions on that example?
[15:38:02] <kushal> For the people joining late, https://shellshare.net/r/summertraining
[15:38:19] <buvanesh_kumar> !
[15:38:30] <Ananthu> !
[15:38:30] <kushal> next
[15:38:38] <Ananthu> what is the difference between tab and space
[15:38:40] <buvanesh_kumar> How it adds two values
[15:38:57] <buvanesh_kumar> we didn't mention +
[15:39:10] <buvanesh_kumar> or any additional statements
[15:39:15] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, we did
[15:39:22] <snarwade> buvanesh_kumar, check code properly
[15:39:23] <kushal> >>> def add3(a, b=10):
[15:39:23] <kushal> ...     return a + b
[15:39:33] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, ^^ see, a + there.
[15:39:45] <buvanesh_kumar> oh from the top. got it thanks
[15:39:49] <iKshitij> Kushal that means if we will pass value of b then it will replace previous value (10)
[15:40:14] <kushal> Yes
[15:40:18] <iKshitij> If we won't ! It will b as defined in function !
[15:40:47] <kushal> yes
[15:40:58] <aniketh_> !
[15:41:02] <deep123k> roll call : deepanshu kapoor
[15:42:03] <sandeepk> Ananthu: have look on this --> http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk
[15:42:10] <kushal> next
[15:42:24] <buvanesh_kumar> asked. got answer. thanks
[15:42:25] <kushal> next
[15:42:26] <kushal> next
[15:42:52] <aniketh_> can we set the value for b=10 permanently for the function
[15:43:01] <avik> Roll Call: Avik Mukherjee
[15:43:33] hell_o is now known as acetakwas
[15:43:37] <kushal> aniketh_, means?
[15:44:02] <kushal> aniketh_, like this?
[15:44:05] <kushal> aniketh_, add10?
[15:44:18] <poonam> Roll call : Poonam Jadhav
[15:45:09] <aniketh_> Kushal, Yes.
[15:45:20] <kushal> :)
[15:45:22] <kushal> next
[15:46:01] <aniketh_> but it should not accept any values while in function call
[15:46:05] <kushal> Now everyone, write me a function which is return True if the argument to the function can be divided by 2, or else return False.
[15:46:24] <kushal> def by_two(number):
[15:46:31] <buvanesh_kumar> Now if i define a value for a and call the function. it will add the a and b values ?
[15:46:36] <Ananthu> batul I understood. Thank you.
[15:46:37] <kushal> ^^ do not show me here, just tell done here.
[15:46:49] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, try and see
[15:47:02] <avik> !
[15:47:08] <iKshitij> kushal I think he is asking we can set value of b permanently for the function ? like Here when we are passing a value of b to function. It's replace value of b !
[15:47:40] <iKshitij> But what if we want to set b = 10 permanently !
[15:48:15] <kushal> in the first line write, b = 10 :)
[15:48:32] <kushal> without smiley
[15:48:35] <kushal> next
[15:48:39] <avik> did you discussed the last problem? I joined late :( can i find it in the log later?
[15:48:44] <abhishekg5> haha
[15:48:49] <aniketh_> !
[15:48:50] <kushal> avik, No
[15:49:03] <kushal> avik, we started fresh from the function chapter.
[15:49:05] <kushal> next
[15:49:11] <aniketh_> kushal, inside the function right ?
[15:49:14] <avik> oh ok
[15:49:16] <kushal> aniketh_, yes
[15:49:31] <buvanesh_kumar> I am getting anonymous error
[15:49:32] <aniketh_> kushal , okay
[15:49:42] <buvanesh_kumar> can you please see that => https://paste.fedoraproject.org/404352/
[15:50:26] <abhishekg5> buvanesh_kumar: give the argument
[15:50:28] <PrashantJ> buvanesh_kumar, Please pass argument to add10
[15:50:32] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, yes, you have to call the function with the argument
[15:50:34] <kushal> add10(a)
[15:50:46] <rahuldecoded> >>>print(add10())
[15:51:03] <kushal> rahuldecoded, wrong
[15:51:09] <rahuldecoded> Sorry
[15:51:09] <buvanesh_kumar> gave argument. now works. thanks kushal abhishekg5 PrashantJ
[15:51:10] <kushal> you are not passing the value of a
[15:51:22] <abhishekg5> cool
[15:51:29] <rahuldecoded> >>>print(add10(0)). Typo!
[15:51:31] <Aizen> !

[15:52:47] <Aizen> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/404353/70664276/
[15:52:56] <Aizen> can you please help me with this ?
[15:53:16] <sandeepk> kushal: function body of def by_two(number) https://da.gd/vzW5P
[15:53:34] <aman_> done tp://paste.fedoraproject.org/404355/64352147/
[15:53:42] <PrashantJ> Aizen, its 'False' and 'True'
[15:53:48] <aman_> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/404355/64352147/
[15:53:50] <rahuldecoded> Aizen true not TRUE
[15:53:54] <kushal> sandeepk, aman_ this is exactly why I asked not to paste :(
[15:53:59] <Aizen> need to write True and false in '' ?
[15:54:04] <kushal> Why can not people read what I am writing :(
[15:54:05] <snarwade> Aizen, use % instead of /
[15:54:09] <PrashantJ> Aizen, no
[15:54:28] <aniketh_> kushal , is this right ? https://paste.fedoraproject.org/404358/14706643/
[15:54:31] <PrashantJ> Aizen, 'True' without quotes
[15:54:31] <abhishekg5> Aizen: it's not TRUE. It's True. Same with False
[15:54:45] <Aizen> ok
[15:54:46] <sandeepk> kushal: oops sorry :), in excitement i do that :(
[15:54:51] <snarwade> Aizen, give quotes to true or false
[15:55:21] <kushal> snarwade, ?
[15:55:42] <snarwade> kushal, he havnt given quotes to string
[15:55:51] <PrashantJ> aniketh_, use return statement not 'print'
[15:56:04] <kushal> snarwade, that is supposed to be bool
[15:56:06] <kushal> not string
[15:56:18] <kushal> Aizen, also the logic is wrong
[15:56:28] <snarwade> kushal, oh sorry, right
[15:56:36] <abhishekg5> Aizen: yes. use modulo %
[15:56:50] <aniketh_> PrashantJ, okay. No other problems right ?
[15:56:52] <pksadiq> my 2¢: http://paste.debian.net/787429/

[15:58:46] <poonam> http://paste.fedoraproject.org/404361/70664679/
[15:59:10] <kushal> poonam, No.
[15:59:16] <kushal> poonam, issues in that code
[15:59:23] <kushal> 1. You gave a different name
[15:59:32] <kushal> 2. y is string
[15:59:54] <poonam> okay kushal
[15:59:55] <buvanesh_kumar> poonam, why true don't have ( ), ?
[15:59:56] <kushal> 3. You are giving () brackets in the if statement,
[16:00:13] <kushal> 4. You are printing without ()
[16:00:25] <kushal> you are supposed to return
[16:01:07] <aniketh_> PrashantJ, http://paste.fedoraproject.org/404362/66481514/     hope this is right ?
[16:01:25] shridhar is now known as shridhar`brb
[16:01:31] <PrashantJ> aniketh_, True and False without quotes
[16:01:45] <snarwade> kushal, https://paste.fedoraproject.org/404363/47066488/
[16:02:13] <kushal> snarwade, wrong, that is not the name I told
[16:02:17] <kushal> People stop.
[16:02:24] <kushal> Please learn to read the problem first.
[16:02:31] <kushal> it is not difficult.
[16:02:37] <kushal> But it will surely help in life.
[16:03:56] <buvanesh_kumar> but snarwade solution working for me. how it's wrong ?
[16:04:14] <snarwade> buvanesh_kumar, function name is by_two
[16:04:41] <snarwade> thanks kushal
[16:04:42] <kushal> buvanesh_kumar, as I said, please learn to read.
[16:05:21] <buvanesh_kumar> snarwade, i used your method => https://paste.fedoraproject.org/404366/
[16:06:18] <buvanesh_kumar> ok thanks kushal
[16:07:09] shridhar`brb is now known as shridhar
[16:07:10] <kushal> So, please try to read the chapter http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html tonight.
[16:07:24] <kushal> Tomorrow we will try solve various things by writing functions
